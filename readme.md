Document Storage System
===

This was the semester project for the Data Structures course at Yeshiva University. Coded in Java, this is a system that handles the storing of and searching for documents (both plain text and binary data), moving them between disk and memory as needed. As part of this project, I coded several data structures - hash tables, stacks, tries, heaps, and B-trees - from scratch.
